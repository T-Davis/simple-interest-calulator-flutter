# Interest Calculator with Flutter!

This app will make you rich! ...Or at least show you how.

Did you know that there's a magic box that you can put money into, and when you open it again there'll be more money in there?!
It's called an index fund.

Now I know this doesn't sound fun, but follow along for a second.
If you invest $1 today, make a reasonable 7% return and continue to invest the yield, in 30 years you now have $7.
So the next time you're at the coffee shop, ask yourself, does future you really think you need a $35 latte? Yeah, me neither.
